## **EVERLEDGER**
### **Real-world examples**
Diamonds are hard to find. It can be extracted from rocks that are a billion years old. But it is also difficult to prove the legitimacy of such a rock. Whether the seller is telling the truth or the rock is just an ordinary stone, it is intractable to find out.
### **Enter Everledger**
It is also troublesome if one deals with stones coming out of disputed regions. Therefore, it is important to know each and every detail of a particular stone. Enter “Everledger” which uses Blockchain along with other technologies to provide a solution to this problem. Everledger stores the entire journey of a stone on a Blockchain. It involves right from the origin of the stone to the final certification received, in a blockchain-enabled database. Along with the characteristics of the stone, it also keeps a track of all change of hands.
### **How does it work?**
Right at the inception, the Everledger introduces a Unique Identification Number to each stone received.
Post this, each activity performed on the stone is recorded in the ledger.
This involves tasks like classification, planning, laser cutting, polishing, and certification.
### **Benefits**
Blockchain provides the benefit of preventing fraud. Since the database is tamper-proof and a global record available for each piece, it becomes easier to track a stolen product. Insurance companies and banks can use this database to understand the whereabouts of such a precious item. Reselling of stolen diamonds will provide a missing entry within the database and hence reduce the fraud rate. Everledger tries to create a digital thumbprint of not just diamonds but other valuable items as well like Paintings, Expensive Wines, etc.
## **DEMOCRACY EARTH**
### **Real-world examples**
Moving to our next example, we take a look at Online Voting which uses Blockchain. Democracy Earth is one such foundation that has utilized Blockchain to capture the sentiments of people. In 2016, Colombia was a country voted on a peace treaty between the government and FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). A lot of restrictions were in place for a large number of Colombians away from their country, almost to the tune of 6 million. Democracy Earth tried capturing every Colombian’s voice through online voting and used Blockchain for the same. Instead of just providing a “Yes” or “No”, major other reasons were also listed so that sentimental value can be captured as well. By using Blockchain, the entire data was cryptic in nature as well as tamper-proof. In the midst of rigging witnessed in voting, Democracy Earth provided a fresh solution. Though the online votes were never counted in Colombia's case, a new alternative to decentralized and autonomous democracy was introduced.
