## **CONNECTIVITY**
We live in the world of internet where everything is interconnected. Money flies across continents at just a click of a button. Packages move from one corner of the world to another. Though the Internet has enabled greater connectivity, there are few problems associated with it. One cannot be sure of the person sitting on the other side of the network. We all know about the hazards of online delivery. We all mustâ€™ve heard about fake product delivery. In addition to money lost, a customer also loses their time and the most important factor, i.e., Trust. The Internet was built to make transactions complete in a faster and cheaper way. Alas! Some bear the brunt of this advantageous feature. There were the days when electricity bills were paid only at a physical location. Or the cash could be withdrawn only from a bank. Such scenes are nowhere to be seen now. A major reason behind this disappearance is Internet. But as mentioned before, the Internet has its drawbacks when it comes to a few of its applications. Most importantly when a cash transaction happens.

## **THE RISE OF BLOCKCHAIN**
In 2008, a mysterious pseudonym called Satoshi Nakamoto presented the idea of a Peer-to-Peer Network. It was not like the world had never heard of such a phenomenon before, but the paper talked about money flowing on the network without a single jurisdiction. Before people could understand the concept in detail, Bitcoin made its first appearance in Jan 2009. BOOM! Since then, we have seen tremendous growth in the number of transactions using Bitcoin. Along with the growth of Bitcoin, we have also seen a lot of confusion around the same. Bitcoin is specifically dealing in financial transactions. The technology on which the entire peer-to-peer network stood, Blockchain, is an even more fascinating as well as confusing domain. Blockchain is a very new thing and therefore everyone has their own opinions regarding it. Some consider it to be the future of the Internet while some think of it as a fad. Whatever be the outcome, it is important to know about a technology that shook the fundamentals of our banking system.
