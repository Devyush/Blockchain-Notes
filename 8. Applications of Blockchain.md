## **DIGITAL OWNERSHIP**
### **Different Uses of Blockchain**
Till now, we have read only about Blockchain concerning financial transactions. Since these transactions are quite risky, it makes sense to have a secure network like Bitcoin to protect it. What can be the other scenarios where a Blockchain can be used?
### **Copyright Issues**
The creation of digital content is quite easy nowadays. Ranging from the tunes of a musician to the words of a writer, everything is stored digitally. But with this ease of access comes the problem of ownership. Anyone with a digital copy of real work can claim that it’s their creation. Most of the digital work created is published on the Internet. Anyone can download and claim it to be their own work. This is where the problem of Copyright arises. Such a problem can be solved with Blockchain. We all now understand that once data is recorded onto a Blockchain, it is almost impossible to edit it. This is how a historical record can be kept for each item on the internet.
### **Example of a 'Song'**
Jai is a Singer. He writes songs to perform in his show. Gaurav is a regular audience member enjoying Jai’s shows. He makes a note of all his songs in his diary. After having sufficient content, Gaurav goes to another city and performs with the stolen set. In other words, it’s daylight robbery. But in the current scenario, Jai has nothing to claim that the song is his work.
### **Blockchain Solution to Digital Ownership**
Now, consider that a Blockchain Network is created for digital content. Each block is known by the creator’s name and the actual content (e.g. jokes, stories, photographs, music, etc.) Also, this Blockchain is made Public for reading so that anyone can check the credibility of the content. With this setup in place, Jai adds each new set of his to the Blockchain before any performance. No matter how good or bad the content is, it will always belong to Jai. If Gaurav now tries to perform with stolen content, he can be easily caught by a simple search on the Blockchain. The search will always throw Jai’s name as the ‘Creator’. Also, if Gaurav tries to put the same content on Blockchain under his own work, it will always appear below Jai’s name. This chronology helps in identifying the correct ownership of digital content. Of course! This solution is not usable in its raw form. Many nooks and corners have to be checked before it can be utilized. But with Blockchain, it becomes fairly possible.
## **REDUCTION IN PAPERWORK**
### **Government and Paperwork**
Another scenario where a Blockchain can be deployed is one with which we all are familiar. Government Institutions tend to delay work due to large paperwork. Also, there is a lack of trust when it comes to such situations; this is the reason why a Central Authority is required. Even in such situations, the chronology and historical records play an important role. Consider a case where you have bought a piece of land. In order to register it under your name, a huge pile-up of ledgers and records have to be created. With Blockchain in the picture, a lot of records can be digitized. But in this case, Blockchain will require many other technologies to provide a helping hand. Like OCR (Optical Character Recognition), to convert all scanned documents into a digital copy. The main idea is not to digitize and create a database only, but the solution should ensure that two parties can reach an agreement without having one single body validating the deal. Imagine the Bitcoin idea of reaching a consensus where other nodes give a go-ahead on a particular transaction. On similar lines, if the buyer has to know the legitimacy of the ownership, he/she has to simply check with other nodes in the network. This way a fraudulent piece of ownership papers held by the seller cannot mislead the buyer. It also keeps a track of all the ‘change of hands’ that happened in terms of ownership of the property.
