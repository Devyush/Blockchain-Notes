## **BOONS OF INTERNET**
The Internet is a boon to humanity. The network of networks, also known as the Internet, has provided us with many useful features. Communication costs across the world have been significantly reduced. One can start their own journey and make people aware of it. The basic fundamental of the Internet was to connect any device to the network irrespective of its internal identification. This is the reason why devices like mobiles or televisions, can gain access to required information.

## **INTERNET ISSUES**
But as the common saying goes, “Every rose has a thorn in it”, the Internet too has its own set of issues. Some can be psychological ones like Trolls and Memes. No one is spared on the Internet for their tiniest mistakes.
### **Phishing & Others** 
Apart from memes, there are Online Scams. Fraudsters imitate legit users to gain access to their accounts. This type of attack is called Phishing.
### **Viruses & other wares** 
We also know the age-old preventive measure of never running a .exe file from the Internet. But still, people fall for it and often compromise their systems. Such attacks lead to the situations where a notification shows "You can't open this file!". It means that your FILE is kidnapped. It’s called Ransomware.

## **MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE**
Apart from all the above-mentioned issues, the largest issue with the Internet is related to Trust. Due to the lack of physical presence, various questions crop up. Am I dealing with real people? Is their product authentic and can it be trusted? re only authorized people having access to my data? Imagine your User ID and Password known to the creator of an email service.  Dangerous! Right?

## **ADAPTED COUNTER MEASURES**
### **Enhanced Security**
Most of the Internet Services are Client-Server based. It means that the service provider is the only server of all the received requests. Just like we, the Clients, are not sure about the Server, Servers are also not sure about who they are dealing with. For this reason, a lot of new techniques were created to identify correct clients from fake ones. Techniques like,
* Two-factor authentication (OTP Pin on Mobile)
* Biometrics - Knowing a person from features like fingerprint, retina, etc.
* CAPTCHA - Tiny boxes of numbers are filled to prove that the client is not a software robot  

**CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing Test for telling Computers and Humans Apart) -** It prevents malicious computer code from trying to access the server and therefore is termed as a preventive measure.  
Servers also use a Firewall to restrict the authorization & authentication of communication so that only intended clients are allowed to share information. This helps the Server in identifying legit clients even before any confidential information is shared. If any other malicious client tries to communicate, the server simply ignores it or as the name suggests, burns the message.  
The techniques mentioned till now take care of the Client Identification only. Server Identification can be done by Trusted Certificates placed on it but there is no check for it. Also, if a Server is attacked by a hacker, all information is at stake.
### **Bitcoin’s Security Measure** 
Keeping these issues in mind, Bitcoin employed the features of Blockchain. With the help of this technology, the authority wasn’t restricted to just one entity. Blockchain enables a group of authorities to make a decision.
