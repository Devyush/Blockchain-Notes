## **STRUCTURED & UNSTRUCTURED**
### **Servers are Data-Driven**
Every service over the Internet deals with data. The servers maintain data in either structured or unstructured format. Structured data is like an arrangement of properly parked vehicles. In this, data is divided into rows and columns.
### **Structured Data**
Consider a service which keeps track of your educational qualifications. Each row will capture at least one of your qualifications till date. If there are multiple qualifications, there will be multiple rows for you. Structured Data will use multiple tables to eliminate duplication of data. It is like creating an account on Twitter once and then using the login feature to make it recognize you every time. Imagine creating an account for each tweet that comes to your mind. Because of multiple tables, data can be stored conveniently and logically. So a single row can identify a single person using their name. This same row can then refer to some other table to gather the person’s qualification-related data. Data stored in such a manner makes it easier to search for a record. Structured Data helps in identifying all the qualifications of a single person. It can also search how many people possess a particular qualification. Because every row and column stores distinct pieces of information, it becomes easier to search for any information.
### **Unstructured Data**
The problem with Structured data is that it takes a lot of effort to assemble the data in such a format. Moreover, end-users don't like to look at multiple tables. Imagine your Twitter feed as a table. Doesn’t look great, does it? Unstructured data does not have a set pattern. Social Media sites are a prime example of unstructured data. A tweet can be of either a single character or 280. Sometimes it can hold either an image or a weblink, or even a poll question. With this type of data, there is a lot of uncertainty. It is also difficult to store such types of information in a tabular format. Though a lot of modern techniques have been developed to keep track of all such information.
## **SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE**
### **Centralized Data Access**
We already know about the Client-Server method. It is also known as Centralized Data Access. The server resides in the middle with all the databases. Different systems like PC, Mobile, Tablets or any other medium can access the server. The server needs to be powerful enough to handle all the requests one after another. This makes the Server vulnerable to every possible cyber attack. If the server goes down due to any reason, all the services are affected. In such a scenario, the server becomes a bottleneck for the continuity of its processes.
## **SINGLE POINT OF AUTHORITY**
### **Admin Role**
One of the important ways to limit damage to a database is by defining access roles. This role defines the activities allowed for a particular user. In a simple case, a user can have read-only, or edit access. These activities differ according to the server and the kind of data it holds. So if a user is not allowed to make any changes to the data, they will be given a lesser privileged role. This decision is normally taken by a System Administrator as per pre-set rules. Maybe a certain group of clients (like end-users) will be given only read access. Clients involved in the maintenance of data must be provided with edit access to make any changes. This type of method brings in a hierarchy and makes the system less transparent. The decision-makers are isolated and all others play by their rules.
## **THE BLOCKCHAIN APPROACH**
### **Distributed & Common Consensus**
Blockchain is the type of database where there is no centralized server. All the participants have access to the same data but stored within their territory. Along with this, Blockchain works on a common consensus amongst all its participants. Thus avoiding the vesting of power within just one entity. It is now time to understand how Blockchain overcomes the issues discussed so far. Be it the trust issues over the Internet or the problems on Databases as we just saw.
