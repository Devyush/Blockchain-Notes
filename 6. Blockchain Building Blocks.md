## **PUBLIC AND PRIVATE KEYS**
### **PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)**
In this section, we will just talk about three of the most important facets of Blockchain, i.e., PKI (Public Key Infrastructure).
### **Public Key**
We all know about username or user id in the digital world. It is a way of identification used prominently to provide access to legitimate users. You just can’t shout out someone’s actual name and start communicating with them. The basic requirement is that each person must be known by some identification. The computer program will just identify the username. It won’t have any idea about who is using it in reality. Considering our case, we are dealing with sensitive information. Financial Transactions, Govternment approved Identifications, all such things are critical information. When a server is dealing with such information, a user is not entrusted with the job of choosing his/her user id. There is a central authority that creates a person’s identification. This is known as a Public Key. It is in a form that is extremely difficult to be memorized. It can run to the tune of close to 300 digits or more depending upon the algorithm used to produce it. The Public Key of a person is announced to the world. In simple terms, think of Public Key as your email Id. No one keeps it secret if they want to be communicated.
### **Private Key**
With the same Public Key’s algorithm, a user’s Private Key is also generated. The algorithms make sure that the generation of a Public and Private key shouldn’t result in the same combination. Private Keys are never disclosed to the world. Just like you should never reveal your passwords.
### **Public & Private Key**
Consider a scenario where two participants on a PKI Infrastructure want to communicate. A very secret message is to be passed between the two members. Person A is the sender and Person B is the receiver. The PKI is nothing but a part of Cryptography. “Crypt” means changing the message so that the real characters make no sense to anyone. Only the intended recipient has a key that changes the message back to its original form. The former process is called encryption whereas the latter is called decryption. Now, when Person A has to send a private message to B, he/she will use B’s Public Key to encrypt the message. B can decrypt the same by using its own Private Key. If A would’ve encrypted the message with any other person’s Public Key, the message wouldn’t have been decrypted by B. The PKI provides a pair of Public & Private Keys that are related to each other.
## **HASH FUNCTIONS**
### **Hash Mystery**
Till now, we have been talking about each participant receiving input related to each transaction that has happened in the network. That is a lot of information moving around. This is where a Hash function helps us.
### **What is a Hash function?**
Hash is another cryptographic function. Its job is to accept an input which can be anything from someone’s name to a number denoting your bank account number. In cryptography, the idea is to change the input so that it looks nonsensical. A Hash function will do something similar. It will encrypt the input but with the following conditions:
* The output produced will be always a fixed number of characters.
* Any change in the input will result in a completely different output.

Have a look at the table below, to understand more.
|Input|Output generated using SHA-1 Hash Algo|
|----|------|
|Blockchain|efe3fbaa6db3f43cf45d8ee3fdb168cd448afa41|
|Block chain|6afea6620ea6a19cd50b8a193cc926f125f5e612|
|BLOCKCHAIN|250bb5c1438a0e7b6d9c9b3cdad461cda221c187|

From the above table, even if the input is smaller than 40 characters, the output would be still 40 characters long only. The input to a hash function can be even a single character or thousands, but the output will always be a combination of a predefined number of characters. If the same input is given twice, the output will remain the same as well. The importance of a hash function comes out when it is impossible to generate the original message from the hashed value. Instead of real transaction values, Blockchain stores its hashed values. If all the participants have the same hashed value of a transaction, it means the database is consistent. A lot of storage space is saved if the transactions are hashed. Since the hashed value will always be of fixed size.
## **NONCE**
### **Making sense of Nonce(nce)**
A nonce is a number that can be used only once. It will never use the same value which has been used already. Imagine a mathematical equation like “9 + x = 10”. We always have to “Find x” in such an equation. This value of x is nothing but our Nonce. The nonce is a value used along with a regular transaction that happens in a bitcoin environment. This becomes the input for the Hash function. Hash ( Transaction AND Nonce). In Bitcoin, the goal is to get a predefined Hash Value as an output. Consider the Hash output shown previously for “Blockchain”. A probable predefined hash value can start with “1234” and then the remaining 36 characters are generated. In order to generate such a value, the nonce is changed every time. This trial and error method is used until the designated hash is generated. We cannot change the actual value of a transaction and hence a Nonce is used.
