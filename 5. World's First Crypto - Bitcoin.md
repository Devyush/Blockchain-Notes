## **INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL CURRENCY**
### **Advances in Communication**
Mankind has come a long way in the field of communication. It all started with two people separated by geographical boundaries but still able to communicate. Be it by sending pigeons across the globe or just by pressing a button to initiate a WhatsApp call. The next step that was achieved with communication was payments. Initially, the payments were passing through an intermediary like Banks. This was nothing but Client-Server architecture in action. The 2008-Financial Crisis posed many questions on the legacy of the Banks. People became wary of trusting banks and how they conducted their operations. During these uncertain times, the idea of electronic cash came into the limelight. Early 2009 saw the first such idea in action, Bitcoin was live and kicking. It was completely the opposite of a Banking system. The power of authority was residing with the participants instead of a central authority. Bitcoin is the equivalent of Digital Currency. It can be even used as a commodity on which two parties can trade. But for it to be useful, Bitcoin must be lucrative enough. In other words, it must bear some value. For any entity to be valuable, it must be scarce in number, difficult to obtain, and useful enough to be traded. Due to this, Gold, Silver, Oil, and all such minerals are valuable for everybody. But Bitcoin is just a code, a number on the screen. But what makes it valuable?
## **HOW BITCOIN WORKS?**
### **Bitcoin in Action**
Each transaction that occurs on Bitcoin is recorded in a Ledger. A ledger is nothing but a collection of financial transactions that happened to date. The architecture is similar to what was discussed in The 4 Friends example. A particular transaction is recorded with several other transactions happening on the network. All these transactions along with their time of creation are then grouped together and that is known as a Block. Every time a new Block of such transactions is created, it is added to the front of the most recent block created to date. This joining of blocks is just the updating of our ledger till date. This whole ledger, in turn, is nothing but the Blockchain. Now, Bitcoin has defined certain scenarios for the creation of a Block. Only when all the conditions are met, a block is added. But for these conditions to meet, systems have to do intensive calculations. These calculations demand resources like Computing Power and Electricity. Due to this, the addition of Blocks becomes a very difficult process. For each block added in the chain, fresh Bitcoins are introduced in the system. Just like new currency notes are printed. It’s the job of the Miners to keep on striving for adding “blocks” in the system. This whole process of getting a block added into the Bitcoin ecosystem, makes it valuable. It works just like any other valuable commodity like oil. If the demand for the commodity is high, the supply mechanism is bulked up. In addition to the work of the miners, each transaction is broadcasted to all the participants. But only the transactions included in the block added to the chain are considered legit. All the participants in the network must update their databases with the newly added block. A block once added becomes immutable.
