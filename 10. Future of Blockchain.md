## **SMART CONTRACTS**
### **Trust Issues**
We all live in a world that is governed by some other authoritative third party.
From the prices of foodgrains to the movies we watch, everything is governed by some intermediary.
Blockchain as a technology is trying to remove this middlemen business.
One of the major parts which helps it in doing so is nothing but Smart Contracts.
Ideally, smart contracts shouldn’t be seen as something that comes only with Blockchain.
But its rise to fame has been because of its early implementation via Blockchain.
### **Smart Contract**
Smart Contracts are nothing but self-executing contracts.
It is just like a physical contract where there will be multiple participants, clauses, consequences, and probably every bit of detail stored digitally.
This digital format of contract doesn’t act just like a repository.
Instead, such a contract is turned into a computer code that can be executed when certain conditions are met.
Depending upon what event has occurred, a smart contract can then execute the corresponding action.
### **Smart Contracts in Bitcoin**
In a much simpler avatar, Smart Contracts are just like a Logic Sequence defining If-Else statements.
We have seen something similar with Bitcoin as well.
When a transaction is validated by Miners, the corresponding changes happen in the ledger of each participant.
If a participant was transferring some bitcoin to another member, this action is triggered only after validation is done.
Thus, validation becomes the event while the transfer of bitcoins is the action.
Smart Contracts, being in a codified form, are stored on a Blockchain Network.
Therefore, Smart Contracts are immutable and distributed.
This means that the satisfaction of a condition depends on the consensus of the majority of the participants.
## **EXPLORING ETHERIUM**
### **Ethereum & Smart Contracts**
Ethereum is created on a Blockchain platform, just like Bitcoin.
But the distinction comes with Ethereum’s platform to create Smart Contracts.
Any type of agreement can be created using Ethereum as it is not just a currency-based blockchain.
A simple Smart Contract could be “releasing rent money on every 10th of the month” to the landlord's account.
But complex scenarios can be taken care of as well.
Say, you have decided to sell an old item online.
This can be achieved with the help of existing players like eBay or Craigslist.
But a certain charge will be levied on both, the buyer as well as the seller.
Our problem can be solved by putting up a Smart Contract on Ethereum (Blockchain).  

Step 1: Seller requests bid for his/her product as per the bidding method chosen.  
Step 2: Buyers put in bids and a single winner is chosen.  
Step 3: Buyer puts in the actual bid amount in some storage on the network. Since the environment is distributed, everyone has the same copy of money being transferred to the common storage.  
Step 4: Seller receives the winning bid and transports the product to the winner.  
Step 5: After scrutiny, the buyer agrees to take in the product.  
Step 6: Money gets transferred from common storage to the seller.  
Step 7: All the losing bid amounts are returned to the prospective buyers.  

This entire transaction is caught on a distributed network and therefore it has all the characteristics of a Blockchain Network.
Various clauses can be added for uncertain events where the delivery is not received or accepted.
Since this Smart Contract is running on Ethereum’s network, a small charge will have to be paid to execute the entire contract.
This is negligible as compared to the actual deal value.
Similarly, a Smart Contract can be applied in various places.
All the different examples we have covered till now for Blockchain will always have Smart Contracts at their heart.
Be it the Online Voting or Everledger’s record-keeping, each will have its own set of rules to run.
