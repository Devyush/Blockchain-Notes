## **TECHNICAL CHALLENGES**
### **Issues with Blockchain**
Blockchain is a fascinating technology.
But every good product comes with its own set of challenges and Blockchain as well is no different.
The first of these issues is nothing but Technical in nature.
This is related to the architecture of this technology itself.
### **Technical Issues**
We all know that Blockchain is a peer-to-peer network.
This signifies that every node has a copy of the entire record of transactions till date.
So a single addition or modification in the database creates a ripple effect across the entire network.
Due to this the time duration for a transaction to complete increases considerably.
Of course, the network works swiftly but it is the validation of a transaction that requires time.
Unless the miners are able to add a block to the existing chain, a participant is uncertain about the outcome.
On top of this issue, we have already seen the scenario where multiple chains are created.
Finding the right chain to continue with, incurs some more time on completion of a transaction.
Another issue is related to the security of the network.
We all have seen how Blockchain creates a hack-proof environment.
But just like any other technology, a Private Key is always in danger of being stolen.
If this key is compromised then there is little Blockchain can do to safeguard itself.
Due to this a large number of transactions can be processed without the user’s consent.
Blockchain’s founding characteristics are being anonymous and making irreversible transactions.
Both of these characteristics stand opposite to the traditional systems we all have grown up with.
A modification button is the most important aspect of the IT world.
But Blockchain comes with a disabled modification button.
Also, within Blockchain examples, we have seen applications that are focused on a single objective or so.
But for scaling Blockchain adoption, it is required that different chains which are completely separate in terms of records possessed, should be able to communicate.
Lastly, Blockchain requires some complex coding.
Moreover, it is important to know the conceptual part first in order to even start with coding.
This in turn, significantly reduces the comfort level of learners with respect to the technology.
## **PEOPLE CHALLENGES**
### **People Issues**
As we have seen before, Blockchain changes the traditional way of doing business.
Sometimes instead of perceiving this to be a fresh change, people take it more as a shock.
The absence of third parties or intermediaries creates doubt amongst the participants.
Moreover, the possibility of a system that governs itself just on the basis of codes increases the anxiety level of participants.
But every major technological shift comes with this caveat.
A bigger problem than this resides with the awareness level of the masses.
Very few people understand how blockchain works.
But even lesser than that understands the true potential of the technology.
It is also important to know the correct stage of a Blockchain.
## **REGULATORY CHALLENGES**
### **Regulatory Issues**
The last from the list includes various institutions which are directly affected due to this technology.
It is going to be harder for institutes like Banks and Governments to accept such technology.
Initially, there seemed to be less interest in the technology from the view of the intermediaries.
It made lesser sense for institutes like Banks to invest in this technology which can make their existing architecture obsolete.
In addition to this, with an autonomous architecture where no node is superior to another, lack of ownership crops up.
This requires the creation of newer laws and regulations.
Of course, all of the above issues have some or the other workarounds.
Blockchain is a fairly new technology that will keep on evolving and therefore everyone will keep reading about newer aspects.
