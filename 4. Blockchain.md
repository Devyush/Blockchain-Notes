## **UNDERSTANDING BLOCKCHAIN**
### **The 4 Friends**
Blockchain is a way of reading and writing data in databases. It is surely different from the traditional approach of data in rows and columns. To understand the same, let’s consider a scenario of 4 friends namely, Gaurav, Jai, Esha and Karan. Let’s call this group The 4 Friends.
### **Edit transactions**
The 4 Friends have decided to keep a track of money lent amongst them. A sheet is updated on Jai’s door as and when any transaction happens. But Gaurav keeps on editing (or even canceling) many of the records.
### **Vulnerable Data**
The problem with the above situation is obvious. Since the data is stored at only one location, it can easily be tampered with.
### **Decentralization**
Esha came up with a solution of letting everyone know about the transaction even if they are not involved in it. This way everyone will maintain their copy of the sheet. If a record is debatable, then all the sheets will be compared. If the majority of the sheets hold the concerned record, then that record will be deemed correct.
### **False messaging**
After a few months, it turns out that Karan owes a huge amount to Jai and he certainly doesn’t have the money to pay off his debts. He tries to trick the system by telling everyone except Jai about the repayment of this record. Karan adds the same entry in Jai’s sheet without him noticing it. Later on, Jai denies entering such a record but his cries are put to deaf ears as everyone has the same record.
### **Validation**
Now, Jai has come up with another change to their system. He announces to The 4 Friends, “All the parties involved in a transaction must validate it.” This is how The 4 Friends created a paper-based Blockchain system. Who knows if they are Satoshi Nakamoto, whom the world is still looking for?
## **WHY BLOCHKCHAIN?**
### **A probable Blockchain environment**
The 4 Friends does have a partial Blockchain amongst them but it is still on paper. Imagine all of them having a smartphone and transactions happening digitally over the internet.
### **Importance of Consensus**
If Karan tries to broadcast a false transaction with Jai, it won’t go through as Jai will mark such a record as invalid. If the consensus is not reached, then that transaction won’t be added by others. The legitimacy of a transaction is proved only if it is approved by all the participants.
### **Problems for Attacker**
Even if any of the participants try to change records, he/she will have to do it on each database held by each participant. Because of the decentralization of data, the complexity for an attacker increases widely.
## **IMMUTABILITY**
### **Mutable v/s Immutable**
An item is called mutable if it can be changed. A Blockchain system is immutable and therefore once a record gets captured, it cannot be changed.
### **Advantages of Immutability**
Immutability helps in reducing fraudulent transactions. If a person tries to double spend the same money on two people, the Blockchain can identify it. It will always favor the transaction which happened earlier.
## **ZERO CENTRALIZATION**
### **Disruptive Innovation**
We’ve already seen how trust is a major factor with Internet transactions. Blockchain brings in zero centralization and thus eliminates the requirement of a third party. A third party can be either a bank or an institution that overlooks a concerned transaction.
### **Taking out middle-men**
As mentioned in The 4 Friends’ case, everyone keeps a track of all the transactions. This in turn reduces the charge paid by consumers on transactions that go through a third party like Bank.
### **Micropayments**
Also, banks impose a phenomenal charge on each of the transactions for maintaining their servers and databases. Due to this, people avoid buying a low-cost item of a few dollars as they will have to pay some more amount to the bank as overhead charges. The same applies to the sellers who pay some amount of money to the banks.
### **Minimal charge in Blockchain**
With decentralization and distribution of data, no third parties are involved. Customers can manage to do a low-price transaction as well. Even with Blockchain, a processing charge is paid but it is almost negligible. The infrastructure over here is nothing but nodes connected to the internet.
