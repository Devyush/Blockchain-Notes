## **BITCOIN'S CRYPTIC NATURE**
### **Anonymity in Bitcoin**
Bitcoin is a Cryptocurrency. The reason behind it being crypto is the usage of PKI. Each participant on a Bitcoin network is identified by its Public Key. No one ever knows in reality who they are dealing with. Therefore, Bitcoin is a major hit with criminals. As discussed earlier, each transaction’s hash value is stored in every participant’s ledger. Now, if Person A has to make a bitcoin transaction to Person B, the following steps will occur:
1. The current hash of all the transactions can be considered as plain text.
2. This will be signed by A but only by using B’s Public Key.
3. This record will now be read by Person B using his own Private Key.
4. Now, B can validate the transaction by adding it in its version of the entire Blockchain.

One possible problem in this setup is that B cannot verify if A has done a Double-spend or not. The only way to avoid this is by using Esha’s solution. It specified that each transaction made must be known to all the participants. Whenever a transaction is added to a block, it is maintained chronologically. This is done with the help of a timestamp. A timestamp is a record that helps in identifying when a particular event occurred exactly. When a person does double-spending, the chronology of transactions is affected. Some participants may receive that Person B is paid while some may receive that Person B is not paid. Due to this, the Bitcoin database will not remain consistent. But as we know that there is no Central Authority that can intervene and resolve this issue, the matter is decided amongst the participants itself. The thumb rule for each participant is to accept whichever transaction happened earlier and that one must be included in their ledger. If more than 51% of the entire ledger says that B was paid before anyone else, then the entire Bitcoin will accept this transaction. But if this is otherwise, then B will not be considered to have received the Bitcoin. This is how Bitcoin eliminates the Double-Spending Problem.  
This whole scenario brings light to an important aspect of Bitcoin or Blockchain. If a person receives a Bitcoin at any time, that particular entity is not considered as spendable from that particular instant. The network has to look at if the majority of participants have accepted a particular transaction or not. Therefore, Bitcoin or Blockchain doesn’t happen in real-time. Due to the enormity of the network, there will always be some delay before the consensus has reached. You may be wondering, what happens with the participants who have the wrong transaction listed in their ledger. The idea is that a participant will always store all the records, right or wrong, in its database. This is where a chain separates within a Blockchain, one is correct and the other one is wrong. From here on, if a new transaction comes in, each participant will store it in the respective branch of the chain. The correct branch can be identified with the help of a timestamp. Only when one of the branches keeps on growing swiftly because the majority of the network is favoring that particular branch of the chain, then the entire network reaches a consensus that the shorter chain is obsolete and hence not to be used.
